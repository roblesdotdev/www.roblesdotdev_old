<b>You're hunting around for the lowest price.</b> I don't compete on prices. 
And I don't have a fixed or hourly rate. I charge on a per project/value base, 
and only provide high quality work that is worth investing in. If you're just 
looking for someone to get the work done and are not interested in how, then 
you should probably be looking somewhere else.

<b>You need someone to do quick work.</b> Quick work often means less quality 
work; and I don't offer that. 
  `.trim(),
  `
<b>You need a designer to design your Web site/app UI.</b> While I have a soft 
spot for design, I am not a designer and therefore don't do any design work.

  `
<b>You are building a new team.</b> I am comfortable working in small teams 
with well-defined goals and as few meetings as possible.
